# 作业

## PART1

1) Give the three representations of an AND gate and say in your words what AND means.
2) Give the three representations of an XOR gate and say in your words what XOR means. 
3) Draw a circuit diagram corresponding to the following Boolean expression: (A + B)(B + C) 
4) Show the behavior of the following circuit with a truth table:
5) What is circuit equivalence? Use truth table to prove the following formula. (AB)’ = A’ + B’


## PART2

6) There are eight 1bit full adder integrated circuits. Combine them to 8bit adder circuit using the following box diagram.
7) Logical binary operations can be used to modify bit pattern. Such as (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2= (0000X4X3X2X1)2 We called that (00001111)2 is a mask which only makes low 4 bits to work. Fill the follow expression 
(1)  (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 or (00001111)2 = (           )2 
(2)  (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 xor (00001111)2 = (           )2 
(3)  ((X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and(11110000)2 ) 
or  (not (X8X7X6X5X4X3X2X1)2 and (00001111)2)  =  (           )2
 

## PART3

### Logic gate 逻辑门

In electronics, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device. 

在电子学中，逻辑门是实现布尔函数的理想化或物理设备；即，它对一个或多个二进制输入执行逻辑操作并产生单个二进制输出。根据上下文，术语可以指理想逻辑门，例如具有零上升时间和无限扇出的逻辑门，或者它可以指非理想物理器件。

### Boolean algebra 布尔代数

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively.

在数学和数学逻辑中，布尔代数是代数的分支，其中变量的值是真值true和false，通常分别表示1和0。
